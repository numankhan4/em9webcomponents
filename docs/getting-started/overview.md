## Quick Start

Add the following code to your page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://numanulaq.com/dist/themes/light.css" />
<script type="module" src="https://numanulaq.com/dist/em9Library.js"></script>
```

Now you have access to all of em9-Library's components! Try adding a button:

```html preview expanded
<em9-button>Click me</em9-button>
```

?> This will load all of em9-Library's components, but you should probably only load the ones you're actually using. To learn how, or for other ways to install em9-Library, refer to the [installation instructions](getting-started/installation).

## What Problem Does This Solve?

em9-Library provides a collection of professionally designed, highly customizable UI components built on a framework agnostic technology. Why spend hundreds of hours (or more) building a design system from scratch? Why make a component library that only works with one framework?

With em9-Library, you can:

- Start building things faster (no need to roll your own buttons)
- Build multiple apps with different frameworks that all share the same UI components
- Fully customize components to match your existing designs
- Incrementally adopt components as needed (no need to ditch your framework)
- Upgrade or switch frameworks without rebuilding foundational components

If your organization is looking to build a design system, [em9-Library will save you thousands of dollars](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/and-you-thought-buttons-were-easy-26eb5b5c1871).\* All the foundational components you need are right here, ready to be customized for your brand. And since it's built on web standards, browsers will continue to support it for many years to come.

Whether you use em9-Library as a starting point for your organization's design system or for a fun personal project, there's no limit to what you can do with it.

## Browser Support

em9-Library is tested in the latest two versions of the following browsers.

<img src="/assets/images/chrome.png" alt="Chrome" width="64" height="64">
<img src="/assets/images/edge.png" alt="Edge" width="64" height="64">
<img src="/assets/images/firefox.png" alt="Firefox" width="64" height="64">
<img src="/assets/images/opera.png" alt="Opera" width="64" height="64">
<img src="/assets/images/safari.png" alt="Safari" width="64" height="64">

Critical bug fixes in earlier versions will be addressed based on their severity and impact.

If you need to support IE11 or pre-Chromium Edge, this library isn't for you. Although web components can (to some degree) be polyfilled for legacy browsers, supporting them is outside the scope of this project. If you're using em9-Library in such a browser, you're gonna have a bad time. ‚õ∑
